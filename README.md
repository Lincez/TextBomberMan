TextBomberMan
=============

Bomberman clone made with Entity-Component System - pure text

This is a test for when I was learning the ECS technic. 
It is a pure text Bomberman game clone. 
My objective with putting it on Github is to improve what I did on it because I have learned a lot since then.

It's not finished, but the content is playable (kind of). Just compile and run it, to move the main character used the WASD keys and to put a bomb use the 'L' key.
